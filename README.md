**Project Description:**

Our project is a car racing game that allows the player to play in a third or first person POV. 

**How to Run:**

Mac: download repository folder and run "host.command"

Windows: download repository folder and run "host.bat"

Open Google Chrome to "http://localhost:8001/"

**Game Controls** 

"i" = forward

"k" = backward

"l" = turn to the right

"j" = turn to the left

"m" = map

"c" = switch camera view

"Control+1" = play track one

"Control+2" = play track two

"Control+3" = play track three

"g" = start race

"h" = finish race

**Race for your best Pace**

After testing the controls and getting the hang of maneuvering the car, set yourself to the track you would like to race. 
Start the race by pressing "g" and go for your best time. Watch out! Driving off the track onto the grass will result in slowing your car down.  Also, watch out for objects such as the ramp of track three, as colliding into them will bonk your car back and take away your velocity.

Race the track for your desired amount of laps and then press "h" to get your time. Keep racing to beat your best time and become a CS174a Formula One Racing legend!
